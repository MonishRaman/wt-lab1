# Portfolio — Resume & Bio-data

This workspace contains a small multi-page website demonstrating a Resume and a Bio-data page.

Files added:

- `index.html` — Landing / overview with links to resume and bio-data.
- `resume.html` — Printable resume page with contact, experience and projects.
- `biodata.html` — Traditional bio-data page with personal details.
- `css/style.css` — Styles for layout, responsive behavior and print.
- `js/main.js` — Small jQuery-based interactions (theme toggle, print, smooth scroll).

How to view

1. Open the project folder in your file explorer.
2. Double-click `index.html` (or open it in your browser).

Notes

- Uses Google Fonts and Font Awesome via CDN; an internet connection is needed to fetch them.
- The print button on `resume.html` triggers the browser print dialog; use "Save as PDF" to export.

Feel free to ask for customizations (colors, fonts, content, or converting to a single-page app).
